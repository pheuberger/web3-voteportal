## What's this about

This is a way for me to learn web3. This project started out as a weekend project from https://buildspace.so.

It's a very simple voting tool, that allows you to change your vote at any time. It's currently deployed at https://awesome-curran-a439fd.netlify.app/.

The smart contract is deployed onto the Rinkeby testnet.
